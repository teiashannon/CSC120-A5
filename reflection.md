- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Originally, I thought that association would not make much of a difference in my programming. I thought that it might feel just like programming assignments I did last year. However, it really helped me to break everything down piece by piece. Not only did it help my brain work through the logistics of the many different aspects of this assignment, it also helped me find bugs in my code faster, because I knew exactly what each little part of my program did.
What worked for me in doing this assignment was working through it piece by piece and making sure each part worked on its own before moving to the next part. This ensured that any bugs I ran into were clear and easy to fix. Additionally, taking breaks from the code and coming back to it was helpful. Also, starting with the smallest part of the program (the boots) and then moving on to larger parts was helpful for me as I became more comfortable with the work. Additionally, working through the assembly of the scarecrow by thinking about our memory model exercise we did in class was very helpful, as I got a little lost at one point but was able to figure out how the computer was reading and storing my code and thus how I should fix it to get the results I wanted.
